Provide consultancy and delivery services around the APIs and API security domains. I have a T-shaped skillset that gives a global picture of the products I am working on and allow me to fast onboard on any of those.

The company leverages boruta (https://github.com/malach-it/boruta-server), an Identity and Access Management solution for which I provide integration services. Knowing that the product is OpenID certified, it gives amongst others a single source of truth for your identities in your infrastructure and enables OAuth 2.0 and OIDC security which are world-class standards.

If any of those subjects are of your concern, do not hesitate to reach out!
